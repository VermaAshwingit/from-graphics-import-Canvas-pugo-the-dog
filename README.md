Meet Pugo, your very own virtual dog! In this interactive project, you can feed and play with Pugo to keep him happy and healthy. His expressions change based on how he's feeling—he’ll smile when he’s happy and frown when he’s hungry or bored. Use the buttons to care for Pugo and see how he reacts in real time!
